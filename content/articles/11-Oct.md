Title: Working with Kubernetes

Summary: Kubernetes-related project work

Today I worked on Kubernetes-related projects which taught me a lot about the difference between Node Groups, Pods, Clusters, and the likes. The 
configuration process is seems to be complicated but that seems more so dependent on the project’s vast scope rather than a fault of Kubernetes. 
The main project I worked on today required a series of tasks be performed before code updates could be applied, so once I was done with the 
Kubernetes side of things I submitted about 3 PR’s to apply my changes. The first merged seamlessly, the second had some changes that needed 
further investigation, and the third was blocked on the second. After resolving the concern raised by the second PR, I resubmitted it for review 
where it is now sitting with the third PR again.

The problems addressed today allowed me to get a lot more hand-on experience with k8s and k9s, and I’ll likely to continue on this work tomorrow.

Summary: Performing a Kubernetes upgrade on Production 


Today I set up time with the NOC team to get approval to make an upgrade to production services.
After receiving approval, I prepared a report covering the release notes of the upgrades that
will be performed for the rest of the team. I'll be up from 11pm - 5am doing this, so I'll likely
take the day off tomorrow. After sorting all that out, I started researching and planning what 
should be done next for our self-hosted CI runners.

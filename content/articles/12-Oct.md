Summary: Documentation migration

Most of today was spent contacting other teams regarding service desk tickets and my ticket on 
documentation migration. My primary focus was building a list of resources teams needed transferred,
but I also had to spend time configuring a service account for a team who needed additional permissions
within their Kubernetes cluster.

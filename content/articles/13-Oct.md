Summary: Summary of what I did today and what I learned.

Today was spent mostly on approving PRs. There's a new project being worked on and there's a particular 
process for what needs to be changed and what needs to be approved, so a few hours were spent today going
over that with the team. Once that was established, I worked through a series of PR's and applied that 
new process. I also met with a different team to review next steps regarding the Kubernetes service account
ticket from yesterday.
